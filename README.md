In this project I take a messy e-commerce dataset, clean and transform the data, then upload it into a MySQL schema for query. I analyze the cleansed dataset and build two machine learning models for it: 1. SalesForecaster 2. ProductRecommender. I then build an API so that the models can be used in a web app.
